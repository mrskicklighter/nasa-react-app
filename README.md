This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

React Code Louisville Project 

Connecting to Nasa Image of the Day API

Each route is a seperate endpoint 
Home page pulls 10 random images 
Today page loads the most recent image 
SearchDate pulls one specfic date 
Multiple allows to get images between a start date and end date 

The styling could still use work! 

Need to change what the page says while loading, currently says invaid date but just hasnt loaded yet

There are some warnings in console, but ran out of time to fix them for the Code Louisville class due date

Thank you !
